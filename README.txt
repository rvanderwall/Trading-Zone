Trading Zone is a new site loaded with tools to help sellers and buyers alike.

Caracal is the site for buyers and it's claim to fame is the match engine, called the caracal hunter after
the cool lynx-like cat.

The search engine examines all incoming for-sales posts, matches against stored search criteria and
issues emails to buyers who may have an interest in the item just posted.

It's built on Django, bootstrap, and NLTK
