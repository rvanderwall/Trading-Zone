Caracal is a new For Sale site.  It's claim to fame is the match engine, called the caracal after
the cool lynx like cat.

The search engine examines all incoming for-sales posts, matches against stored search criteria and
issues emails to buyers who may have an interest in the item just posted.

It's built on Django, bootstrap, and NLTK
